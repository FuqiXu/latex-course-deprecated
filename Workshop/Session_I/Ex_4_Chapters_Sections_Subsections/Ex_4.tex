% 2. Create a title of your document using \title{text}
% 3. Include the author using \author{names} inside \author{Name Surname\thanks{name@email.com}} to include your email id
% 4. Begin your document using \begin{document} environment
% 5. Generate the title page use \maketitle
% 6. Do this at the very end, you can generate a list of contents using \tableofcontents

% ****************************** Insert the text from Ex_4.txt ************************

% 7. Typeset Chapter Titles using \chapter{title}, Sections using \section{title}, subsection using \subsection{title}
% 7.b If you are curious try creating a section 2.1.1.1

% 8. Go now and generate a list of contents using step 6. 
% 9. Change one of the section \section{title} to \section*{title} (note the asterisk before {title}) and see what happens on the contents. Using * will not list the section in the contents, also it doesn't add section number to the section!
