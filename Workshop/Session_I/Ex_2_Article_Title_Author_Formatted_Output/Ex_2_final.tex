\maketitle

Squire Trelawney, \textbf{Dr.~Livesey}, and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island, and that only because there is treasure not yet lifted, I take up my pen in the year of grace \textbf{17--}, and go back to the time when my father kept the \textbf{``Admiral Benbow"} inn, and the brown old seaman, with the sabre-cut, first took up his lodging under our roof.
